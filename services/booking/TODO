📌 TODO: Seasonal Bias Pricing Logic
🔄 Overview
Implement seasonal pricing adjustments for service categories based on annual demand patterns. This will stack with existing geo and currency pricing logic.

🧠 What It Will Do
Apply a seasonal multiplier to base USD price before currency conversion.

Adjust prices up or down depending on time of year and service type.

🧩 Suggested Formula
finalPrice = basePrice * geoBias * seasonBias * customMultiplier
🧰 Steps to Implement
 Create GetSeasonalBias(serviceID string, t time.Time) float64

Option 1: Hardcoded logic by month/service

Option 2: Config-driven (e.g. seasonBias.json)

 Integrate seasonBias into GetServiceByID(), before currency conversion.

 Add tests for different months and services.

🧪 Example Rules
Service	Season	Bias
LawnCare	Apr–Aug (spring/summer)	1.2
MealPrep	Nov–Dec (holidays)	1.4
Childcare	Jun, Dec (school breaks)	1.3
Chauffeuring	May, Dec (events)	1.3
Tutoring	Apr–Jun, Sep–Nov	1.2
PersonalCare	Feb, May, Dec	1.4

⚙️ Optional
 Add admin dashboard controls to toggle or adjust seasonal bias values.

 Store seasonal configs in MongoDB for real-time updates.

 Build analytics to refine seasonal bias with real user data.
